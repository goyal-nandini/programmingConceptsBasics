// = is a binary operator
//we can't overload = using friend function
//The assignment operator needs access to the left-hand object (this) to change its data.
//A friend function cannot act on "this" because itâ€™s not tied to any specific object. 
//A friend function works outside the class. It does not belong to any specific object so it does not have 
//"this" pointer to refer to the left hand object. Since the assignment operator needs to change the left hand 
//object directly only a "member function" can do it.
