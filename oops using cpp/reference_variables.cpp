        // '\n' is a character literal, which is a rvalue (a temporary value that doesn't have a memory address you can modify).
        // References require an lvalue (a variable or object with a memory address) to bind to.
        // Why can't '\n' work?

        // A reference creates an alias for a variable, and a character literal like '\n' is not a variable; itâ€™s just a temporary value stored in memory, which cannot have an alias.
        // char &a = '\n';
        const char &a = '\n';
        //or
        char q = '\n';
        char &p = q;

        cout << n[2] << a;

        int &m = *y;

        cout << &t << a 
        << y << a 
        << m; //m is a reference to t. However, since t is uninitialized, the value printed for m will be undefined (garbage value).

        // int &g = 50; // invalid!!
        //The reason is that references are meant to provide an alias to an existing variable, and in the case of a literal like
        // 50, it doesn't have a memory location that can be aliased.

        const int &g = 50;
        // here, g is a reference to a constant, and it can refer to a temporary value like 50.
        cout << endl << g;
