#### Key Observations

# No shallow Copy Constructor:
In your code, the line myClass obj1(obj); invokes the default copy constructor generated by the compiler. This default copy constructor performs a shallow copy, meaning the pointer data in obj1 will point to the same memory location as data in obj.

Explicitly defining a shallow copy constructor produces the same output as the default behavior provided by the compiler. The reason is that the compiler-generated copy constructor already performs a member-wise shallow copy by default.

By explicitly writing the shallow copy constructor, you make it clear to others reading the code that you're intentionally creating a shallow copy. Without the explicit constructor, someone might assume you forgot to handle the copying behavior.

now I've added it!!

# Memory Management Issue:
Since both objects share the same memory for the data pointer, when the destructor is called for one of them (e.g., when obj or obj1 goes out of scope), it deletes the memory. The other object's destructor will then try to delete the same memory, leading to undefined behavior (typically a double-delete error).
## This is a key issue with shallow copying.
